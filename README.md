Mini Reseau Social
This is a mini social network project built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript, following a "neumorphism" design aesthetic. 

The application simulates a basic social media feed with functionalities for posting, reacting, and commenting on posts, all without using any backend or external APIs. 

The project was created as a coding exercise to demonstrate front-end skills and DOM manipulation.

Features
Feed Page: Displays posts from a JSON file, which are rendered dynamically through DOM manipulation. Each post can contain text or an image, simulating data retrieved from an API.

Fullscreen Image View: Clicking on a post's image opens it in a fullscreen overlay for a closer look.

Reactions: Users can interact with posts by "liking," "disliking," or "loving" them. Each reaction triggers a simple animation effect.

Commenting System: Users can add comments to posts, and even reply to comments. Comments are handled entirely on the client side.

Messaging Page: Displays a list of simulated conversations with a simple message history.

Friends List: Shows a list of friends that users can filter and reorder via drag-and-drop functionality.

Technologies Used
HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface, following a neumorphism design theme.

JavaScript: For handling all DOM interactions, including rendering posts, adding reactions, and managing comments.

How to Use
